# Security Best Practices for .NET & React â€“ 1 Hour Demo

This repository contains a demo showcasing security best practices for modern web applications built with .NET (backend) and React (frontend). The demo aims to scratch the surface of security best practices and provide practical ideas to improve the security of your applications.

**Duration:** 1 Hour

## Contents

- **Slides:**  
  Presentation slides covering key security concepts and best practices, including secure communication (HTTPS, CORS, security headers), authentication (JWT, cookies), rate limiting, UUIDs for resource IDs, and more.

- **Backend:**  
  A simple ASP.NET Core Web API demonstrating secure authentication, rate limiting, security headers, and resource management using UUIDs.

- **Frontend:**  
  A React application that interacts with the backend for login, secure API calls, and resource creation/retrieval.
